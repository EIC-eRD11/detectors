This folder contains one of the simplest possible projects:  a simple material in a beam. 
This simple case is used to show different ways of defining materials in gemc.  Unless using
a predefined GEANT4 element or NIST material directly in the detector definition, there will 
be a materials text file generated by materials.py for input to gemc.

The GEANT4 material database can be found at:
http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/apas06.html

The example should be able to run directly in gemc with the provided text input files and  the gcard option file using the command:
	gemc.command example.gcard
If one wants to generate the text input files from the provided python scripts, the files in the included ‘api/python’ folder must be included in the python path so the modules in the api can be imported.  When this is done, generate the project files using:
	python3 example.py config.dat
WARNING:  this will overwrite the original project text files.
