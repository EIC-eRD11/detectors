--------------------------------------------------

The geometry consists of 36 elliptical mirrors, 36 hyperbolic mirrors
36 PMTs, and 36 WC.

The parameters are created by the mirrors.C macro.

In MYSQL mode, before building the geometry one must
upload the parameters onto the DB.

The commands to build the geometry, banks, hit defs
and materials are:

upload_parameters.pl config.dat   < only for MYSQL factory

./ltcc.pl config.dat
